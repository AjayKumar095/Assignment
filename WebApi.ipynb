    "        An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and protocols that allows one software application to interact with another. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information. APIs enable the integration of different software systems, allowing them to work together seamlessly.\n",

    " <p>\n",
    "        A common real-life example of API usage is in online payment systems. Consider a scenario where an e-commerce website uses a payment gateway API to securely process credit card transactions. The e-commerce application sends a request to the payment gateway API, specifying the transaction details. The API processes the request, communicates with the payment processor, and returns the result to the e-commerce application. This seamless interaction between the e-commerce website and the payment gateway is made possible through the use of APIs.\n",
