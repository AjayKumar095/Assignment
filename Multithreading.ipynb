    "<h3>Multithreading in Python</h3>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<p>\n",
    "        <strong>Multithreading</strong> in Python is a concurrent execution model where multiple threads run in the same process, sharing resources but having their own execution flow. A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process.\n",
    "    </p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Why is it used:</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "        <li>\n",
    "            <strong>Concurrency:</strong> Multithreading allows multiple tasks to execute concurrently, making better use of available resources and potentially improving the performance of certain types of applications.\n",
    "        </li>\n",
    "        <li>\n",
    "            <strong>Responsiveness:</strong> In applications with a graphical user interface (GUI) or any event-driven system, multithreading helps maintain responsiveness. For example, a separate thread can handle user input while another thread performs background tasks.\n",
    "        </li>\n",
    "        <li>\n",
    "            <strong>Parallelism:</strong> Although Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits true parallelism in CPython, multithreading can still be beneficial for I/O-bound tasks, network operations, and certain types of parallelism in other implementations like Jython or IronPython.\n",
    "        </li>\n",
    "        <li>\n",
    "            <strong>Efficient Resource Utilization:</strong> Multithreading can be useful for efficiently using resources like CPU and memory in scenarios where waiting for I/O operations would otherwise waste processing time.\n",
    "        </li>\n",
    "    </ol>\n",

    "<h4>Module used to handle threads in Python:</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "        The <code>threading</code> module is used to handle threads in Python. It provides a high-level interface for creating and managing threads. With this module, you can create, start, pause, and synchronize threads in a Python program.
